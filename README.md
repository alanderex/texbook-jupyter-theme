# TeXbook  Jupyter Notebook Theme

### Prologue:  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Ctextbf%7B%5CTeX%5Ctext%7Bbook%7D%7D">  shall be _thy_ name

When I designed this theme, I was aiming towards a notebook experience which had the elegance and sobriety of a `LaTeX`-generated article, perfectly combined with the flexibility and interactivity of Jupyter notebooks.
And so <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5CTeX%5Ctext%7Bbook%7D"> seemed to be the most obvious solution for a name, a unique [portmanteau](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/portmanteau)
[(1)]( "Pronunciation"),
blending together the words <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5CLaTeX"> and *note**book** *. 
Incidentally, this is also the name of the 
[Donald E. Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth)'s [book](http://www.ctex.org/documents/shredder/src/texbook.pdf) on `TeX`.

That was the omen.. the sign that **this** name was indeed perfect...

> Right!, One!... Two!... Five! [(2)]("Monty Python and the Holy Grail")

The <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5CTeX%5Ctext%7Bbook%7D"> Jupyter notebook theme wishes to pay a tribute of gratitude (in the name, and in the content) to two of the technologies I do use the most as researcher and data scientist.

#### `TeXbook` Jupyter theme in a Nutshell

- *Computer Modern* fonts for Markdown typesetting;
	- *Computer Modern Typesetting* for Markdown Mono	
- `Hasklig` (_open source_) font as the default `monospace` for the **Code** editor;
- `Hack` (_open source_) font as the default `monospace` font for **Markdown** editor (slightly better for text writing, _ed._);
- `md` and `code` colour highlight theme based on Material Design colour scheme.
    - Customisable Colour themes
- Special formatting for `pandas.DataFrame`
- Extra `ad-hoc` CSS classes for Markdown and Code (*output*) formatting

**Last but not least**: to make things even more interesting, the `TeXbook` theme has been made available in three different flavours: 

 	1. **Full-fledged** _custom_ Jupyter notebook theme;
	2. Custom **IPython magic** `%TexBook` as available via a `pip-installable` Python package;  
	3. A custom theme for Google Colaboratory Notebooks (via the [Stylus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylus_(browser_extension)) browser extension).

## Installing/Enabling `TeXbook` theme

The `TeXbook` theme is available as a **full-fledged** `custom.css` that can be setup as the default theme for Jupyter notebooks, and as a pretty handy `IPython` magic which can be easily installed and used in notebooks on demand.

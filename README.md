# TeXbook  Jupyter Notebook Theme

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: ‚ö†Ô∏è
You just hit the `texbook-colab` branch where the TeXbook Google Colaboratory theme is available and maintained.

## Prologue:  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Ctextbf%7B%5CTeX%5Ctext%7Bbook%7D%7D">  shall be _thy_ name

When I designed this theme, I was aiming towards a notebook experience which had the elegance and sobriety of a `LaTeX`-generated article, perfectly combined with the flexibility and interactivity of Jupyter notebooks.
And so <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5CTeX%5Ctext%7Bbook%7D"> seemed to be the most obvious solution for a name, a unique [portmanteau](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/portmanteau)
[(1)]( "Pronunciation"),
blending together the words <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5CLaTeX"> and *note**book** *. 
*Incidentally*, this is also the name of the 
[Donald E. Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth)'s [book](http://www.ctex.org/documents/shredder/src/texbook.pdf) on `TeX`.

That was the omen.. ü§©

> Right!, One!... Two!... Five! [(2)]("Monty Python and the Holy Grail")

The <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5CTeX%5Ctext%7Bbook%7D"> Jupyter notebook theme wishes to pay a tribute of gratitude (in the name, and in the content) to two of the technologies I do use the most as researcher and data scientist.

#### `TeXbook` Jupyter theme in a Nutshell

- *Computer Modern* fonts for Markdown typesetting;
	- *Computer Modern Typesetting* for Markdown Mono	
- `Fira Code` (_open source_) font as the default `monospace` for the **Code** editor (with ligatures support);
- `Hack` (_open source_) font as the default `monospace` font for **Markdown** editor (slightly better for text writing, _ed._);
- `md` and `code` colour highlight editor themes based on Material Design colour scheme.
    - other themes also provided;
    - very easy to create your own custom theme (just a series of CSS variables should do the trick)
- Special formatting for `pandas.DataFrame`
- Extra `ad-hoc` CSS classes for Markdown and Code (*output*) formatting

**Last but not least**: to make things even more interesting, the `TeXbook` theme has been made available in three different flavours: 

1. **Full-fledged** _custom_ Jupyter notebook theme;
2. `pip-installable` Custom **IPython magic** (`%texify`);
3. Custom theme integration for Google Colaboratory Notebooks (via the [Stylus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylus_(browser_extension)) browser extension) (**still experimental**).

### Sneak Peek?

Here is a [**Preview**](https://leriomaggio.github.io/texbook-jupyter-theme/) of how the theme looks like!

## How to 

Installing and Enabling the `TeXbook` theme for your Jupyter notebooks varies depending on which of the three theme settings you decided to use. 

1. [Jupyter Notebook Custom Theme](#custom)
2. [Custom IPython Magic](#magic)
3. [Google Colaboratory Theme](#colab)

### Using `TeXbook` as default Jupyter Notebook theme

Instructions on how to install `TeXbook` as a **full-fledged** CSS Jupyter Notebook theme are available [HERE](https://github.com/leriomaggio/texbook-jupyter-theme/blob/custom-css/README.md#custom) 

<a name="magic"></a>
### Using `%texify` custom IPython magic

Instructions on how to install and enable the `%texify` Jupyter Notebook Extension 
are available [HERE](https://github.com/leriomaggio/texbook-jupyter-theme/blob/notebook-magic/README.md#magic)

### `TexBook` theme for Google Colaboratory

An experimental porting of `TeXbook` to **Google Colaboratory** Notebooks is available as a 
[Stylus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylus_(browser_extension)) importable style. 

#### Why Stylus?

The HTML of a Colaboratory notebook is nothing similar to the standard Jupyter notebook HTML structure
(so the `custom-css` cannot work). In addition, every single Colaboratory Notebook Cell executes and generates
a new `HTML iframe`, which also makes the `texify` IPython magic pretty much useless.

Therefore, the *only* solution I could resort to was using **Stylus**.
Unfortunately it is not as customisable and portable as the IPython magic is, but hey?! Better than nothing :)

#### Install TeXbook Colaboratory Theme 

1. Install Stylus Browser Extension (**only available for Mozilla Firefox** and **Google Chrome**)
    - [Mozilla Firefox Stylus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/styl-us/)
    - [Google Chrome Stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en)

2. Import `google_colab_stylus_theme.json` into stylus

    2.1 Alternatively, it is also possible to Copy&Paste the CSS as it is in the Stylus CSS Editor
        - [Google Chrome Stylus](./google_colab_stylus_chrome.css)
        - [Mozilla Stylus](./google_colab_stylus_mozilla.css)

3. Enjoy!

#### Customising the Colaboratory 

As the general TeXbook theme, customising the Colaboratory Theme is as easy as tweaking 
a bunch of CSS variables:

* `--txbk-content-font-size` : Set the font size of the main notebook content;
* `--txbk-content-line-height` : Set Line height of the main notebook content;
* `--txbk-code-font-family` : Set the font family for code editor;
* `--txbk-md-font-family`: Set the font family for markdown editor;
* `--txbk-code-font-size`: Set the font size for the code editor;
* `--txbk-content-mono-font-size`: Set the font-size of rendered mono Markdown.

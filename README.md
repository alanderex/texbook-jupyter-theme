# `TeXbook` Jupyter Notebook Theme

### Prologue: `TeXbook` shall be _thy_ name

When I designed this theme, I was aiming towards a notebook experience which had the elegance and sobriety of a `LaTeX`-generated article, perfectly combined with the flexibility and interactivity of Jupyter.
And so `TeXbook` seemed to be the most obvious solution for a name, a unique [portmanteau](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/portmanteau)[(1)](#1 "Pronunciation"),
blending together the words `LaTeX` and *note**book** *. 
Incidentally, this is also the name of the 
[Donald E. Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth)'s [book](http://www.ctex.org/documents/shredder/src/texbook.pdf) on `TeX`.

That was the astrological alignment. The sign that this name was indeed perfect...

The <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5CTeX%5Ctext%7Bbook%7D"> Jupyter notebook theme wishes to pay a tribute of gratitude (in the name, and in the content) to two of the technologies I do use the most as researcher and data scientist.
